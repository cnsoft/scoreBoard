scoreBoard
==========

scoreBoard is a simple tool for displaying the score of any game. <br>
The [original scoreBoard](https://github.com/xlcteam/scoreBoard-php) has been written in messy PHP.

## Dependencies
The only real dependency is `python` (preferably cpython2) and `pip` so that you
can install other dependencies (see requirements.txt).

## Installing
* You need to create some virtual environment
* Then install all the dependencies by running `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Then, to get all we need `$ python manage.py collectstatic`
* Now we shall sync the DB `$ python manage.py syncdb`


We really appreciate feedback, so if you have any questions or find any bug please create [new issue](https://github.com/xlcteam/scoreBoard/issues/new).
